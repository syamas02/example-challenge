## Example Coding Challenge hello

## Setup

1. From the Example Challenge Assessment, click on the **fork** button at the bottom of this page. This will **fork** a copy of the challenge repository to your account on Github
2. Go to your own newly created Example Challenge repository on GitHub and **clone** the repo locally. The link is also given below, and should also appear at the bottom of this page after your press the fork button.

```

$ cd example-challenge
```


## Complete the specs

3. Before completing each spec, read the README.md File located in each folder.
4. Write your code in each `solution_*.js` file so that you can pass the specs in located in the `*_specs.js` files
5. Run the test specs to test your code. To run the specs for a directory, you need to go into that directory and run the command `testem`.

```
$ cd example-challenge
$ testem
